2401.04381v1,Spaces where all bijections are morphisms,"Here we classify all topological spaces where all bijections to itself are homeomorphisms. As a consequence, we also classify all topological spaces where all maps to itself are continuous. Analogously, we classify all measurable spaces where all bijections to itself are measurable with measurable inverse. As a consequence, we also classify all measurable spaces where all maps to itself are measurable.",2024,Lucas H. R. de Souza
1911.11405v1,A Note on Computational Complexity of Kill-all Go,"Kill-all Go is a variant of Go in which Black tries to capture all white stones, while White tries to survive. We consider computational complexity of Kill-all Go with two rulesets, Chinese rules and Japanese rules. We prove that: (i) Kill-all Go with Chinese rules is PSPACE-hard, and (ii) Kill-all Go with Japanese rules is EXPTIME-complete.",2019,Zhujun Zhang
2501.13404v1,"Classification of Homogeneous Local Representations of the Singular
  Braid Monoid","For a natural number $n$, denote by $B_n$ the braid group on $n$ strings and by $SM_n$ the singular braid monoid on $n$ strings. $SM_n$ is one of the most important extensions of $B_n$. In [13], Y. Mikhalchishina classified all homogeneous $2$-local representations of $B_n$ for all $n \geq 3$. In this article, we extend the result of Mikhalchishina in two ways. First, we classify all homogeneous $3$-local representations of $B_n$ for all $n \geq 4$. Second, we classify all homogeneous $2$-local representations of $SM_n$ for all $n\geq 2$ and all homogeneous $3$-local representations of $SM_n$ for all $n\geq 4$.",2025,Taher I. Mayassi; Mohamad N.

1210.7708v1,Landau--Kolmogorov inequality revisited,"The Landau-Kolmogorov problem consists of finding the upper bound $M_k$ for the norm of intermediate derivative $|f^{(k)}|$, when the bounds $|f| \le M_0$ and $|f^{(n)}| \le M_n$, for the norms of the function and of its higher derivative, are given. Here, we consider the case of a finite interval, and when all the norms are the max-norms. Our interest to that particular case is motivated by the fact that there are good chances to add this case to a short list of Landau--Kolmogorov inequalities where a complete solution exists, i.e., a solution that covers all values of $n,k\in\N$ (and, for a finite interval, all values of $\sigma = M_n/M_0$). The main guideline here is Karlin's conjecture that says that, for all $n,k\in\N$ and all $\sigma>0$, the maximum of $|f^{(k)}|$ is attained by a certain Chebyshev or Zolotarev spline. So far, it has been proved only for small $n \ge 4$ with all $\sigma$, and for all $n$ with particular $\sigma = \sigma_n$. Here, we prove Karlin's conjecture in several further subcases: 1) all $n,k\in\N$ and all $0 < \sigma \le \sigma_n$ 2) all $n \in \N$, all $\sigma > 0$, with $k=1,2$ 3) all $\sigma > 0$, with $n < 10$ and $0 < k < n$.",2012,Alexei Shadrin
1602.00450v1,"All-in-all-out magnetic domain wall conduction in pyrochlore iridate
  heterointerface","Pyrochlore oxides possessing ""all-in-all-out"" spin ordering have attracted burgeoning interest as a rich ground of emergent states. This ordering has two distinct types of magnetic domains (all-in-all-out or all-out-all-in) with broken time-reversal symmetry, and a non-trivial metallic surface state has been theoretically demonstrated to appear at their domain wall. Here, we report on observation of this metallic conduction at the single all-in-all-out/all-out-all-in magnetic domain wall formed at the heterointerface of two pyrochlore iridates. By utilizing different magnetoresponses of them with different lanthanide ions, the domain wall is controllably inserted at the heterointerface, the surface state being detected as anomalous conduction enhancement with a ferroic hysteresis. Our establishment paves the way for further investigation and manipulation of this new type of surface transport.",2016,T. C. Fujita; M. Uchida; Y. Kozuka; W. Sano; A. Tsukazaki; T. Arima; M.

1612.01842v2,"An Improved One-to-All Broadcasting in Higher Dimensional
  Eisenstein-Jacobi Networks","Recently, a higher dimensional Eisenstein-Jacobi networks, has been proposed in [22], which is shown that they have better average distance with more number of nodes than a single dimensional EJ networks. Some communication algorithms such as one-to-all and all-to-all communications are well known and used in interconnection networks. In one-to-all communication, a source node sends a message to every other node in the network. Whereas, in all-to-all communication, every node is considered as a source node and sends its message to every other node in the network. In this paper, an improved one-to-all communication algorithm in higher dimensional EJ networks is presented. The paper shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a lower average number of steps to receiving the broadcasted message. In addition, since the links are assumed to be half-duplex, the all-to-all broadcasting algorithm is divided into three phases. The simulation results are discussed and showed that the improved one-to-all algorithm achieves better traffic performance than the well-known one-to-all algorithm and has 2.7% less total number of senders",2016,Zaid Hussain
2309.13541v2,"Efficient All-to-All Collective Communication Schedules for
  Direct-Connect Topologies","The all-to-all collective communications primitive is widely used in machine learning (ML) and high performance computing (HPC) workloads, and optimizing its performance is of interest to both ML and HPC communities. All-to-all is a particularly challenging workload that can severely strain the underlying interconnect bandwidth at scale. This paper takes a holistic approach to optimize the performance of all-to-all collective communications on supercomputer-scale direct-connect interconnects. We address several algorithmic and practical challenges in developing efficient and bandwidth-optimal all-to-all schedules for any topology and lowering the schedules to various runtimes and interconnect technologies. We also propose a novel topology that delivers near-optimal all-to-all performance.",2023,Prithwish Basu; Liangyu Zhao; Jason Fantl; Siddharth Pal; Arvind Krishnamurthy; Joud Khoury
